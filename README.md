# Attendance Management System

## Lab Overview
The project is an **Attendance Management System** developed using **PHP** for the backend and **AJAX** for front-end interactions. The system tracks the attendance of students in their respective classes. It provides functionalities for both students and teachers to view attendance data, update attendance status, and calculate attendance percentages.

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **PHP**: Backend logic for handling data processing, querying the database, and sending responses to the frontend.
- **AJAX**: Asynchronous requests for fetching and updating attendance data without requiring full page reloads.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building the frontend user interface and handling dynamic interactions.
- **SQL (MySQL)**: To store and manage student, class, attendance, and enrollment data.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Database Structure
The system relies on the following tables in the database:

- **users**: Stores student and teacher details.
- **classes**: Stores class information like name, credit hours, and the teacher associated with the class.
- **enrollment**: Relates students to the classes they are enrolled in.
- **attendance**: Tracks the attendance for each student in each class, storing whether a student was present or absent during a specific session.

### 2. Classes and Enrollment
- The **enrollment** table connects students to their respective classes through a `class_id`.
- The **classes** table contains information about each class, such as the teacher, class name, credit hours, and more.

### 3. Attendance Tracking
Each record in the **attendance** table stores a student's presence status (`is_present`) for a given class session. The `enrollment_id` links the attendance record to a specific student and class combination.

### 4. Attendance Calculation
For each class, the system calculates the **attendance percentage** by counting the total attended sessions and dividing them by the total number of sessions. This percentage is used to show the studentâ€™s performance in the course.

The attendance percentage is calculated with the formula:


## Workflow

1. **Registration and Login**:
   - Start at http colon //localhost/WebLab10/public/register.php where a user can register and log in.
   
2. **Student and Teacher Views**:
   - Once logged in, users are redirected to the respective views:
     - **Student View**: Displayed using the `Student_view.php` template.
     - **Teacher View**: Displayed using the `Teacher_view.php` template.
   
3. **Controllers and Database Interaction**:
   - The system uses PHP controllers to handle the business logic, such as fetching class data, attendance details, and updating attendance status.
   - The controllers interact with the database to ensure real-time updates and calculations.
   
   The use of PHP controllers for tracking database changes significantly simplified the development of this system.
